# hunt-the-wumpus

Clone of the classic game 'hunt the Wumpus' done to practice clean architecture principals.
This clone is inspired by the book 'Clean Architecture' by Robert C. Martin.

The overengineering is on purpose to experiment with separation of concerns and architecture patters.

All the text in the game is taken from: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus#JavaScript
